		<p> The African Grey is one of the most intelligent parrots on the planet, 
		with an astounding ability to learn and imitate speech that has earned them the nickname,
		“The Einsteins of the Bird World.” There are two distinct subspecies of African Greys: the Congo,
		with a larger body and black beak, and the Timneh, with a smaller body, darker grey feathers, and maroon tail feathers. 
		While these birds are a fairly high-maintenance species and can live for over 50 years, they bond strongly with their
		owners and are affectionate companions.</p>

		They are bold and comical birds that enjoy being the center of attention and are known for their talking and singing. 
		While they adjust well to captivity, these birds require a great deal of attention and mental stimulation, 
		without which they are prone to behavioral problems.
		Amazon Parrots typically live for 40-50 years and in some cases, beyond 80.</p>

		<p>Cockatoos are great companion birds and are known for their affectionate, comical, and mischievous characters. 
		These birds demand a great deal of attention and are commonly referred to as “Velcro birds” as they love being close to their owners.
		The cockatoo species is made up of around 21 different birds, most recognizable for their prominent crests and curved bills, 
		and they can be noisy at times. While these parrots make great pets,
		they are one of the more challenging bird species to care for, and some varieties can live for up to 60 years..</p>

		<p>Birmans are another color-pointed cat like the Siamese and ragdoll. 
		They have blue eyes and a medium-long coat but no undercoat, the primary trait that sets them apart from Persians and Himalayans.
		Birmans were the original stock for breeding ragdolls, so they look very similar, but they have slightly different markings and personalities.
		They are fun, social cats that love attention—from their chosen person.
		They are more of a one-person cat than others.</p>
